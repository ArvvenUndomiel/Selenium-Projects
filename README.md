# Selenium Projects

This repository will hold projects for automation of various practice websites.
First website will be https://demoqa.com/ but in time more and more projects will be added.

At the moment automation will be written in C# using Selenium Webdriver and Nunit frameworks.

Design patterns implemented:
POM
DRY (in progress)
Hermetic test
